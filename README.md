# renderbun

renderbun is a minimal showcase for rendering 3D models using modern frontend tools. Built with React and React Three Fiber, it serves as a learning-friendly playground for exploring interactive 3D elements on the web.

It is designed to present a beautiful, responsive display of 3D models in a modern React-based environment.

## Features

- **3D Scene**: A fully interactive 3D model is featured on the homepage using React Three Fiber.
- **Orbit Controls & Lighting**: Basic camera and lighting setup to create a polished and immersive model viewing experience.
- **Responsive & Styled UI**: Styled with Tailwind CSS for a clean, modern interface that complements the 3D content.

## Tools and Technologies Used

- **React**: UI library for building responsive interfaces  
- **React Three Fiber**: React renderer for Three.js  
- **Drei**: Helpers for React Three Fiber (like orbit controls, environment, etc.)  
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS for styling  
- **Vite**: Lightning-fast build tool for development and bundling
